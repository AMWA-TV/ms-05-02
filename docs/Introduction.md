# AMWA MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework \[Work In Progress\]

The NMOS Control framework is a collection of webIDL class and type definitions and supporting documentation.
It is aimed to serve as the foundation for building devices, components and features in a standard and reusable fashion.

This specification relies on previous familiarity with the following related specifications:

- [MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
- [MS-05-03 NMOS Control Block Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-03)

The [webIDL definitions](../idl/NC-Framework.webidl) contain both core models and feature sets models which only apply to certain features being implemented.
