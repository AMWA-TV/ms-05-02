# AMWA MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework \[Work In Progress\]

The NMOS Control framework is a collection of class and datatype models and supporting documentation.
It is aimed to serve as the foundation for building devices, components and features in a standard and reusable fashion.

This specification relies on previous familiarity with the following related specifications:

- [MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01)
- [IS-12 NMOS Control Protocol](https://specs.amwa.tv/is-12)

The aggregated collection of control class and datatype models is published in the [Framework](Framework.md).
