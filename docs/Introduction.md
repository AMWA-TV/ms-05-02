# Introduction

The NMOS Control framework is a collection of webIDL class and type definitions and supporting documentation.
It is aimed to serve as the foundation for building devices, components and features in a standard and reusable fashion.

This specification relies on previous familiarity with the following related specifications:

* [NMOS Control Architecture (NC-Architecture)](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01/)
* [NMOS Control Blockspecs (NC-Blockspecs)](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-03/)

The webIDL definitions contain both core models and feature sets models which only apply to certain features being implemented.
