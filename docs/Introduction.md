# AMWA MS-05-02 NMOS Control Framework \[Work In Progress\]

The NMOS Control framework is a collection of webIDL class and type definitions and supporting documentation.
It is aimed to serve as the foundation for building devices, components and features in a standard and reusable fashion.

This specification relies on previous familiarity with the following related specifications:

- [AMWA MS-05-01 NMOS Control Architecture Framework](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-01/)
- [AMWA MS-05-03 NMOS Control Blockspecs](https://specs.amwa.tv/ms-05-03/)

The webIDL definitions contain both core models and feature sets models which only apply to certain features being implemented.
