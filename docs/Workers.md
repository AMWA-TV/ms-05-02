# Workers

Workers are classes which handle control or monitoring features for a particular specific device domain.  
All workers MUST inherit from [NcWorker](Framework.md#ncworker).

[Signal workers](Framework.md#ncsignalworker) are workers which have ports and affect the signal paths within the device.
